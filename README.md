## Helpful Git/Terminal commands

`git clone <url> .` — Clone the repo into your current directory

`git commit -am "<message>"` — Commit all staged files
`git push` — push all commits to the remote branch
`git pull` — pull all commits from the remote branch

## Git workflow

Create a feature branch off of main for each issue being worked on. When the branch meets the acceptance criteria, create a PR in github to merge the branch into main.
